    <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a Data Analyst by education and practice. I have been working in the humanitarian sector with the Syrian refugees out here in Lebanon for over two years, hoping I could be part in relieving the tiniest bit of pain for some of these refugees. Before moving to Lebanon in January, 2013, I had lived in the U.S for thirteen years. I lived in Las Vegas and in the San Francisco Bay Area. At the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (<a href="http://www.unlv.edu" target="_blank">UNLV</a>), I finished my BS in Mechanical Engineering and then worked for a couple of years doing research, teaching and tutoring. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I worked as an Acoustical Consultant conducting air-borne and underwater noise studies. In 2010, I started taking courses in Statistics from Santa Clara University and the Community College in San Rafael. Then in January, 2011 I stated my graduate studies in Applied Statistic at California State University, East Bay (<a href="http://www.csueastbay.edu/" target="_blank">CSUEB</a>) in Hayward. I graduated from CSUEB in June, 2012. After I graduated from CSUEB, I interned with Kaiser Permanente for four months until November, 2012. While I was at Kaiser Permanente (<a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/html/kaiser/index.shtml" target="_blank">KP</a>), I worked on interesting projects, one of which was to predict the likelihood of admission of patients from emergency department into hospitals using multiple features such as age, sex, medical history, symptoms, etc. Since I moved to Beirut, Lebanon in 2013, I have worked mainly in the humanitarian sector. However, I have also worked as a Data Analyst for a Nymgo, a telecommunication company located out here in Beirut. While at Nymgo, I used Tableau to visualize and report on data. For the last two years, I have worked as a Database Manager and Monitoring & Evaluation Officer for various Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) </p>
